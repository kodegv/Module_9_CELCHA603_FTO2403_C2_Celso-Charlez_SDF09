# [SDF09] Responsive Footer Design with Tailwind CSS

Create a responsive footer for a website using Tailwind CSS. This project aims to enhance your CSS skills, focusing on responsive design and the utility-first approach of Tailwind CSS.

## Objectives
- Clone the provided starter code.
- Style the footer using Tailwind CSS.
- Apply Tailwind CSS to design a responsive footer.
- Learn to use Tailwind's grid system for layout design.
- Design a newsletter subscription section, a quick links section, and optionally add social media links.
- Test your footer's responsiveness.
- Submit your GitHub repository link via the LMS.

## Challenges
- Learning Tailwind CSS was a challenge in itself - even though I managed to finish this project quite quickly.
- Trying to incpoerate regular HTML elements in between Tailwind CSS confused me at first, but I later got the hang of it. 

## Dark and Light
- The page has both a dark and light theme dependent on your browser or device settings. I made sure that both themes have good contrast with their styling for readability. 

## Colour palette
- The colours I chose for focus on elements, are all colours that compliment one another. However, I left the light theme as a pale blue. But made sure to use some orange for the dark theme for high contrast.

## Misc
- I ended up giving the CodeSpace logo some styling so that it doesn't feel like a random block sitting on the page, but rather a considered element. 

### Thanks for reviewing my SDF09 project!
